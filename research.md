Below you'll find all of the `.md` files within the  `_posts` directory 
  that contain `category: blog` at the top. 

We're currently using this section of the site to host these tutorials,
  but you might want to use it to showcase and describe your `Research`,
  to chronicle various `Talks` you've given over your history, or to
  write about various news or updates that have happened to you.

You can update the `title` of file (line 3) to change the heading of 
  the page and its title in the browser. To change how it's referred to
  in the navigation and/or adjust its url, see `data/navigation.yml` file.
